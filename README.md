This repository also includes a number of additional SHAP, LIME, and model evaluation outputs that were generated during the experimentation and validation phase of the research but were not directly included as figures in the dissertation.

These outputs were produced to:

Validate the stability of behavioural patterns across alternative class structures

Test additional model configurations and interpretability scenarios

Examine robustness of SHAP and LIME explanations under different modelling setups

Support model selection decisions described in the methodology

Although not all of these visuals were included in the final thesis due to space, clarity, and reporting focus, they serve as supporting analytical evidence of the modelling process.

They demonstrate the depth of experimentation conducted before selecting the final reported models.

This aligns with the statement in Chapter 3:

“Alternative model configurations and interpretability outputs were evaluated and are provided in the Appendix for transparency.”

All these files are located in the outputs/ directory.
